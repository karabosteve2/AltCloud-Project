* Purchased the domain `kayhub.xyz` via Namecheap.

### 5. Linking to Cloudflare

* Added domain to Cloudflare for DNS and security management.

* Configured DNS records to link domain to EC2 public IP.
* **Enabled SSL/TLS encryption via Cloudflare** to secure the domain with HTTPS.

### 6. Deployment

* Deployed the HTML page to the EC2 instance.
* Configured Nginx to serve the landing page.
* **Tested SSL certificate functionality** to ensure secure HTTPS access to the site.
* Verified that both IP address and domain load the project.

### 7. README File

* Created a step-by-step README to explain the setup process.
* Documented technologies used, live preview, and all steps clearly.

### 8. Git Pushing
